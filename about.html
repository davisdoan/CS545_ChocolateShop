		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		<p> Founded in 1678 by Bertha herself, Bertha's Deluxe Chocolate's intent is to share the delicious chocolate treats with the world through truly addicting chocolate.</p>
		<p>Bertha's Deluxe Chocolate is family owned and operated. Passed down from generation to generation, the current owner is Bertha "Hershey" The 20th. The chocolate is all sourced from Bertha's small vilage in Venezuela. Bertha's rules to keep sourcing the ingredients from venezuela is a reflection of the company's commitment to quality and consistency in their chocolate.</p>
		<p>Initially, the company started with a single boutique in San Diego, CA featuring chocolate bars of all sorts. The signature flavor was milk chocolate which became world famous. This shop is the only shop in the world to receive a Michelin Star of 3. The milk chocolate flavor won over judges from all over the world.</p>
		<p>Today there is a Bertha's Delux Chocolate shop on every country and has sold over 1 billion tons of chocolate. There are national holidays to celebrate Bertha's chocolates in France, Italy, Canada, and New Zealand.</p>
		<p>All of the chocolates are created right here in the USA and still sourced from the same farms in Venezuela since the start.</p>
